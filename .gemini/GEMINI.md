## Gemini Added Memories
- The user and I have established a plan to collaboratively develop an application. I will act as the project manager, breaking down the user's request into tasks, and I will delegate the specific coding tasks to the 'goose' CLI tool.
- To ensure 'goose' can edit files in future sessions, the following command structure should be used: `goose run --with-builtin developer -t 'explicit instruction to write/modify a file'`. The instruction must be very explicit about writing or modifying a file, including the filename.
- **Current Project Status**: We have successfully implemented the foundational commands (`configure`, `import`, `list`, `show`, `add-task`, `update-task`).
- **`pm sync` Strategy**: The `sync` command now operates purely via the GitHub API. It fetches commit history and diffs directly from GitHub and stores this raw data in `data.json`. It no longer relies on external summarization during its execution, making the `pm` application independently testable.
- **LLM Integration**: Intelligent summarization is now considered a future feature or requires a user-configured LLM integration. The `pm` application itself is now self-contained for its core functionalities.
- **New Feature Implemented**: The `pm list` command now displays the Wiki status for each tracked project, indicating whether a GitHub Wiki exists for that repository.
- **New Feature Implemented**: The `pm new <project-name>` command now creates a new GitHub repository and adds the project to `pm`'s tracking.
- **New Feature Implemented**: The `v0.1.0-alpha` release has been created on GitHub, allowing `pm` to be installed via `pip` without Poetry.
- **New Feature Implemented**: The GitHub Wiki has been populated with detailed documentation and its Markdown rendering issues have been addressed.
- **New Feature Implemented**: An `install.sh` script has been created to allow direct installation of `pm` via `curl`.
- **Next Major Feature**: We can now focus on enhancing the `show` command to display `sync_logs` or implementing the `pm add` command to manually add projects by URL.
