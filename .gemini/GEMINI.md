## Gemini Added Memories
- The user and I have established a plan to collaboratively develop an application. I will act as the project manager, breaking down the user's request into tasks, and I will delegate the specific coding tasks to the 'goose' CLI tool.
- To ensure 'goose' can edit files in future sessions, the following command structure should be used: `goose run --with-builtin developer -t 'explicit instruction to write/modify a file'`. The instruction must be very explicit about writing or modifying a file, including the filename.
- **Current Project Status**: We have successfully implemented the foundational commands (`configure`, `import`, `list`, `show`, `add-task`, `update-task`).
- **Next Major Feature**: Implement the `pm sync` command.
- **`pm sync` Strategy**: The `sync` command will now operate purely via the GitHub API. It will fetch commit history and diffs directly from GitHub, without requiring local cloning of repositories. This makes `pm` lightweight and independent of local codebases, aligning with the user's vision for a mobile-friendly and non-intrusive project manager.
- **LLM Integration**: The summarization of commits will initially use the Gemini API. We have a future goal (Phase 4) to integrate a local, open-source LLM for privacy and offline capabilities, with a modular design to allow switching between engines.
